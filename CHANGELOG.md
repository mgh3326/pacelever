# Changelog

## v0.1.1

- Read both legacy text and native structured `last_error` snapshot metadata.
- Ignore retired-provider cache entries before decoding their provider-specific
  shapes, retaining measurements for supported pools.

## v0.1.0

Initial Go CLI/library, admission and launch parity, eight providers, compatible
configuration and observations, bench/rep/grade workflows, optional downshift
experiments, and PR outcome evidence. Superseded for legacy-cache migration by
v0.1.1.
